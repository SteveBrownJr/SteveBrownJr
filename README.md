- 👋 Hi, I’m @SteveBrownJr
- 👀 I work as an embedded software developer.
- 📚 I finished my studies at Obuda University. But some topics from my classes are still available. [Like this.](https://github.com/SteveBrownJr/SpecialTypes)
- 👉 Check my current project: [DIY_ESP32_Quadrocopter 🌱](https://github.com/SteveBrownJr/DIY_ESP32_Quadrocopter) I worked on every single part alone.
- 😏 If you are interested in similar DIY guides check out our Keyboard repository: [KBB-Keyboard](https://github.com/Asapgiri/kbb-keyboard). I worked on the firmware a lot.
